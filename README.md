# Warning

Do not ship a production app with secrets in the .env file. This tutorial shows you how to upload to IPFS via your react client directly as a demonstration only.

When you are ready for production, you should refactor your application to upload IPFS files using a backend service.

Read this for more context on React environment variables.
